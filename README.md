## About:
This library exposes an API for C programs to create and run threads. The main code for the library is in LWP.c. Look at the spec for more information about this project, it is very involved!

Please note, this program is designed for the Unix operating system, it may not work when run on a different OS. 

For examples on how to use the library, see numbersmain.c, hungrysnakes.c, and randomsnakes.c. All these files make use of the light weight process library to launch threads.
